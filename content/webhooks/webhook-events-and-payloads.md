## About webhook events and payloads

You can create webhooks that subscribe to the events listed on this page. Each webhook event on this page includes a description of the webhook properties for that event. If the event has multiple actions, the properties corresponding to each action are included. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks/creating-webhooks)."

### Delivery headers

HTTP POST payloads that are delivered to your webhook's configured URL endpoint will contain several special headers:

- `X-GitHub-Event`: Name of the event that triggered the delivery.
- `X-GitHub-Delivery`: A [GUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_unique_identifier) to identify the delivery.{% ifversion ghes or ghae %}
- `X-GitHub-Enterprise-Version`: The version of the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance that sent the HTTP POST payload.
- `X-GitHub-Enterprise-Host`: The hostname of the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance that sent the HTTP POST payload.{% endif %}{% ifversion not ghae %}
- `X-Hub-Signature`: This header is sent if the webhook is configured with a [`secret`](/rest/repos#create-hook-config-params). This is the HMAC hex digest of the request body, and is generated using the SHA-1 hash function and the `secret` as the HMAC `key`.{% ifversion fpt or ghes or ghec %} `X-Hub-Signature` is provided for compatibility with existing integrations, and we recommend that you use the more secure `X-Hub-Signature-256` instead.{% endif %}{% endif %}
- `X-Hub-Signature-256`: This header is sent if the webhook is configured with a [`secret`](/rest/repos#create-hook-config-params). This is the HMAC hex digest of the request body, and is generated using the SHA-256 hash function and the `secret` as the HMAC `key`.
- `User-Agent`: This header will always have the prefix `GitHub-Hookshot/`.

To see what each header might look like in a webhook payload, see "[Example webhook delivery](#example-webhook-delivery)."

### Example webhook delivery

You can choose to have payloads delivered in JSON format (`application/json`) or as URL-encoded data (`x-www-form-urlencoded`). Following is an example of a webhook POST request that uses the JSON format.

```shell
> POST /payload HTTP/2

> Host: localhost:4567
> X-GitHub-Delivery: 72d3162e-cc78-11e3-81ab-4c9367dc0958{% ifversion ghes or ghae %}
> X-GitHub-Enterprise-Version: 2.15.0
> X-GitHub-Enterprise-Host: example.com{% endif %}{% ifversion not ghae %}
> X-Hub-Signature: sha1=7d38cdd689735b008b3c702edd92eea23791c5f6{% endif %}
> X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=d57c68ca6f92289e6987922ff26938930f6e66a2d161ef06abdf1859230aa23c
