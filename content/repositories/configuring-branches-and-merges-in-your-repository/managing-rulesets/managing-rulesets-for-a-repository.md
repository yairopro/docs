After creating a ruleset, you can make changes to the ruleset to alter how people can interact with the targeted branches or tags. For example, you can add rules to better protect your branches or tags, or you can {% ifversion repo-rules-enterprise %}switch your ruleset from "Evaluate" mode to "Active" after testing its effects on the contributor experience for your repository{% else %}temporarily disable a ruleset to troubleshoot any unintended effects on the contributor experience for your repository{% endif %}.

You can use the REST and GraphQL APIs to manage rulesets. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/repos/rules)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/graphql/reference/mutations#createrepositoryruleset)."

{% ifversion repo-rules-enterprise %}
{% tip %}

**Tip:** If you're the owner of an organization, you can create rulesets at the organization level. You can apply these rulesets to specific repositories in your organization, and to specific branches in those repositories. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/creating-rulesets-for-repositories-in-your-organization)."

{% endtip %}
{% endif %}

## Viewing rulesets for a repository

Anyone with read access to a repository can view the rulesets targeting the repository. This can be useful if you want to know why you can't commit to a branch. On the "Rulesets" page, you can view the active rulesets targeting a certain branch or tag. {% ifversion repo-rules-enterprise %}You will also see rulesets running in "Evaluate" mode, which are not enforced.{% endif %}

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-branches %}
1. To the left of the branch, click {% octicon "shield-lock" aria-label="This branch is protected" %}.

   ![Screenshot of a list of branches in a repository. Next to the "main" branch, an icon of a shield with a keyhole is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/repository/view-branch-rules.png)
1. Optionally, to view the rulesets for another branch or tag, use the branch selector dropdown menu.

   ![Screenshot of the "Rulesets" page. Above a ruleset, a dropdown menu, labeled with a branch icon and "team-test," is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/repository/rulesets-branch-selector.png)
1. Click the name of the ruleset you want to view.

## Editing a ruleset

{% ifversion repo-rules-enterprise %}
{% note %}

**Note:** If a ruleset was created at the organization level, you cannot edit the ruleset from the repository's settings. If you have permission to edit the ruleset, you can do so in your organization's settings. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-rulesets-for-repositories-in-your-organization#editing-a-ruleset)."

## Viewing insights for rulesets

You can view insights for rulesets to see how rulesets are affecting a repository. {% data reusables.repositories.about-ruleset-insights %}

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
1. In the left sidebar, under "Code and automation," click **Rules**, then click **Insights**.

   ![Screenshot of the sidebar of the "Settings" page for a repository. The "Rules" sub-menu is expanded, and the "Insights" option is outlined in orange.](/assets/images/help/repository/ruleset-insights.png)
1. On the "Rule Insights" page, use the dropdown menus at the top of the page to filter the actions by ruleset, branch, actor, and time period.
