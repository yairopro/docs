      **LOW:**  An attacker could circumvent branch protection by changing a PR base branch to an invalid ref name. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/). 
    - |
      Packages have been updated to the latest security versions. 
  bugs:
    - |
      In rare circumstances, Git commits signed with SSH keys using the RSA algorithm would incorrectly indicate the signature was invalid. 
    - |
      Issues with cross references to pull requests from deleted accounts would not load. 
    - |
      The site admin page for organizations erroneously included a "Blocked Copilot Repositories" link. 
    - |
      The checks in the merge box for a pull request did not always match the the checks for the most recent commit in the pull request. 
    - |
      When a site administrator used GitHub Enterprise Importer on versions 3.7 and below to migrate repositories from GitHub Enterprise Server, the system backup size would increase after running many migrations due to storage files not being cleaned up. 
    - |
      API results were incomplete, and ordering of results was incorrect if `asc` or `desc` appeared in lowercase within the API query. 
    - | 
      A collaborator with the "Set the social preview" permission inherited from the "Read" role couldnt upload the social preview image of a repository. 
    - |
      In some cases, on an instance with GitHub Actions enabled, deployment of GitHub Pages site using a GitHub Actions workflow failed with a status of `deployment_lost`. 
    - |
      On an instance in a high availability configuration, existing nodes with out-of-sync repositories prevented new nodes from replicating those repositories. 
    - | 
      GitHub Enterprise Server was queuing zip jobs unnecessarily. 
  changes:
    - |
      The description of the `ghe-cluster-balance` command line utility clarifies that it can be used to balance jobs other than `github-unicorn`. 
    - |
      Administrators can display all repositories in a network with `spokesctl` by using the `repositories` subcommand. 
    - |
      Site administrators can see improved diagnostic information about repositories that have been deleted. 
    - |
      The secondary abuse rate limits of the GraphQL API are now configurable in the Management Console. [Updated: 2023-09-01]
  known_issues:
    - |
      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - |
      The GitHub Packages npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - |
      In a repository's settings, enabling the option to allow users with read access to create discussions does not enable this functionality.
    - |
      Custom patterns for secret scanning have `.*` as an end delimiter, specifically in the "After secret" field. This delimiter causes inconsistencies in scans for secrets across repositories, and you may notice gaps in a repository's history where no scans completed. Incremental scans may also be impacted. To prevent issues with scans, modify the end of the pattern to remove the `.*` delimiter.

    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.
    - |
      On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
    - |
      If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
    - |
      When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
