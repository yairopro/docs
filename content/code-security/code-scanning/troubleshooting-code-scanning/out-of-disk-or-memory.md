{% ifversion ghes %}
On very large projects, you may see `Error: "Out of disk"` or `Error: "Out of memory"` on self-hosted runners when running {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %}. In this case, you may need to increase the memory or disk space available on your runners. You can review the recommended hardware resources for running {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} to make sure your self-hosted runners meet those requirements. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/recommended-hardware-resources-for-running-codeql)."

## Use self-hosted runners

Self-hosted runners offer more control of hardware, operating system, and software tools than {% data variables.product.company_short %}-hosted runners can provide. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)." You can review the recommended hardware resources for running {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} to make sure your self-hosted runners meet those requirements. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/recommended-hardware-resources-for-running-codeql)."

{% ifversion actions-hosted-runners %}
## Use larger runners
You can use larger runners, which are {% data variables.product.company_short %}-hosted runners with more RAM, CPU, and disk space than standard runners. These runners have the runner application and other tools preinstalled. For more information about larger runners and the specifications you can use with them, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-larger-runners)."{% endif %}
