## About {% ifversion code-scanning-without-workflow %}advanced setup for {% endif %}{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}

{% ifversion code-scanning-without-workflow %}
Advanced setup for {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} is helpful when you need more granular control over your {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} configuration. By creating and editing a {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} workflow file, you can change the scan schedule, scan any {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %}-supported language, use a matrix build, and more.

{% else %}
{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_caps %} helps you catch vulnerabilities in the code in your repository. With {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %} {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}, you can select custom or built-in query suites for use in your analysis, set a specific scan schedule, choose which events trigger a scan, and more.
{% endif %}

You can also configure {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} with third-party tools. For more information, see "[Configuring {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} using third-party actions](#configuring-code-scanning-using-third-party-actions)."

{% data reusables.code-scanning.about-multiple-configurations-link %}
{% data reusables.code-scanning.codeql-action-version-ghes %}

{% ifversion code-scanning-without-workflow %}
If you do not need a highly customizable {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} configuration, consider using default setup for {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}. For more information on eligibility for default setup, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning#requirements-for-using-default-setup)."
{% endif %}

### Prerequisites

Your repository is eligible for {% ifversion code-scanning-without-workflow %}advanced setup{% else %}{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}{% endif %} if:
- it uses {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %}-supported languages or you plan to generate code scanning results with a third-party tool.
- {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} are enabled.{% ifversion fpt %}
- it is publicly visible.{%- elsif ghec %}
- it is publicly visible, or {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} is enabled.{%- elsif ghes or ghae %}
- {% data variables.product.prodname_GH_advanced_security %} is enabled.{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghae %}
Before configuring {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} for a repository, you must ensure that there is at least one self-hosted {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} runner available to the repository.

Enterprise owners, organization and repository administrators can add self-hosted runners. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners)."

## Configuring advanced setup for a repository

Advanced setup for {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} is helpful when you need to customize your {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}. By creating and editing a workflow file, you can choose which queries to run, change the scan schedule, select the languages to scan, use a matrix build, and more.

### Configuring advanced setup for {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} with {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %}

You can customize your {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} by creating and editing a workflow file. Selecting advanced setup generates a basic workflow file for you to customize.

{% data reusables.code-scanning.billing %}

{% ifversion fpt %}
  {% note %}

  **Note:** You can configure {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} for any public repository where you have write access.

  {% endnote %}
{% endif %}

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
{% data reusables.user-settings.security-analysis %}
1. Scroll down to the "{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_caps %}" section, select **Set up** {% octicon "triangle-down" aria-hidden="true" %}, then click **Advanced**.

   {% note %}

   **Note:** If you are switching from default setup to advanced setup, in the "{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_caps %}" section, select {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="Menu" %}, then click {% octicon "workflow" aria-hidden="true" %} **Switch to advanced**. In the pop-up window that appears, click **Disable {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %}**.

1. To customize how {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} scans your code, edit the workflow.

   Generally, you can commit the {% data variables.code-scanning.codeql_workflow %} without making any changes to it. However, many of the third-party workflows require additional configuration, so read the comments in the workflow before committing.

   For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/customizing-your-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages)."

1. Click **Commit changes...** to display the commit changes form.

   ![Screenshot of the form to create a new file. To the right of the file name, a green button, labeled "Commit changes...", is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/repository/start-commit-commit-new-file.png)
1. In the commit message field, type a commit message.
1. Choose whether you'd like to commit directly to the default branch, or create a new branch and start a pull request.
1. Click **Commit new file** to commit the workflow file to the default branch or click **Propose new file** to commit the file to a new branch.
1. If you created a new branch, click **Create pull request** and open a pull request to merge your change into the default branch.

In the suggested {% data variables.code-scanning.codeql_workflow %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} is configured to analyze your code each time you either push a change to the default branch or any protected branches, or raise a pull request against the default branch. As a result, {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} will now commence.

The `on:pull_request` and `on:push` triggers for code scanning are each useful for different purposes. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/customizing-your-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning#configuring-frequency)."

### Configuring {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} using third-party actions

{% data reusables.advanced-security.starter-workflows-beta %}

{% data reusables.advanced-security.starter-workflow-overview %}

{% data reusables.code-scanning.billing %}

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.actions-tab %}
1. If the repository has already at least one workflow configured and running, click **New workflow** to display starter workflows. If there are currently no workflows configured for the repository, go to the next step.

   ![Screenshot of the Actions tab for a repository. The "New workflow" button is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/security/actions-new-workflow-button.png)

{% endif %}
{% ifversion ghes < 3.5 %}
## Reasons for the "Analysis not found" message

If you used a pull request to add {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} to the repository, you will initially see an "Analysis not found" message when you click **Details** on the "{% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_caps %} results / TOOL NAME" check in a pull request.

![Screenshot of the details for a code scanning result. Under "GitHub Code Scanning / {% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %}" is the heading "1 analysis not found."](/assets/images/enterprise/3.4/repository/code-scanning-analysis-not-found.png)

The table lists one or more categories. Each category relates to specific analyses, for the same tool and commit, performed on a different language or a different part of the code. For each category, the table shows the two analyses that {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} attempted to compare to determine which alerts were introduced or fixed in the pull request.

For example, in the screenshot above, {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} found an analysis for the merge commit of the pull request, but no analysis for the head of the main branch.

After {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} has analyzed the code in a pull request, it needs to compare the analysis of the topic branch (the branch you used to create the pull request) with the analysis of the base branch (the branch into which you want to merge the pull request). This allows {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} to compute which alerts are newly introduced by the pull request, which alerts were already present in the base branch, and whether any existing alerts are fixed by the changes in the pull request. Initially, if you use a pull request to add {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} to a repository, the base branch has not yet been analyzed, so it's not possible to compute these details. In this case, when you click through from the results check on the pull request you will see the "Analysis not found" message.

There are other situations where there may be no analysis for the latest commit to the base branch for a pull request. These include:

- The pull request has been raised against a branch other than the default branch, and this branch hasn't been analyzed.

  To check whether a branch has been scanned, go to the {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning_caps %} page, click the **Branch** drop-down and select the relevant branch.

  ![Screenshot of the "Code scanning" page. In a header row, a dropdown for a filter labeled "Branch" is expanded. In the dropdown, a branch called "release-candidate-1" is selected.](/assets/images/help/repository/code-scanning-branch-dropdown.png)

  The solution in this situation is to add the name of the base branch to the `on:push` and `on:pull_request` specification in the {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} workflow on that branch and then make a change that updates the open pull request that you want to scan.

- The latest commit on the base branch for the pull request is currently being analyzed and analysis is not yet available.

  Wait a few minutes and then push a change to the pull request to retrigger {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}.

- An error occurred while analyzing the latest commit on the base branch and analysis for that commit isn't available.

  Merge a trivial change into the base branch to trigger {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %} on this latest commit, then push a change to the pull request to retrigger {% data variables.product.prodname_code_scanning %}.
