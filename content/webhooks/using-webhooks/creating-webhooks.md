## About creating webhooks

{% ifversion fpt %}You can create webhooks to subscribe to specific events on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} that occur in a repository, organization, {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} account, or {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} account. You can also set up a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} to recieve webhooks when specific events occur on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghec %}You can create webhooks to subscribe to specific events on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} that occur in a repository, organization, {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} account, or {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} account. You can also set up your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} to recieve webhooks when specific events occur on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.{% endif %}

{% ifversion ghes or ghae %}You can create webhooks to subscribe to specific events on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} that occur in a repository, organization, or {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %}. You can also set up your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} to recieve webhooks when specific events occur on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.{% endif %}

For more information about the different types of webhooks, see "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks/about-webhooks)." For a complete list of webhook events, see "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads)."

## Creating a repository webhook

You can create a webhook to subscribe to events that occur in a specific repository. You must be a repository owner or have admin access in the repository to create webhooks in that repository.

You can use the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} web interface or the REST API to create a repository webhook. For more information about using the REST API to create a repository webhook, see "[AUTOTITLE](/rest/webhooks/repos#create-a-repository-webhook)."

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-settings %}
{% data reusables.webhooks.sidebar_webhooks %}
{% data reusables.webhooks.add_webhook_button %}
1. Under "Payload URL", type the URL where you'd like to receive payloads.
{% data reusables.webhooks.content_type_and_secret %}
1. Under "Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?", select the webhook events that you want to receive. You should only subscribe to the webhook events that you need.
1. If you chose **Let me select individual events**, select the events that you want to trigger the webhook.
1. To make the webhook active immediately after adding the configuration, select **Active**.
{% data reusables.webhooks.add_webhook_button %}

After you create a new webhook, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will send you a simple `ping` event to let you know you've set up the webhook correctly. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#ping)."

## Creating an organization webhook

You can create a webhook to subscribe to events that occur in a specific organization. You must be an organization owner to create webhooks in that organization.

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}

## Creating a {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} webhook

You can create a webhook to subscribe to events relating to an app that you published in {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}. Only the owner of the app, or an app manager for the organization that owns the app, can create a {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} webhook. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/publishing-apps-to-github-marketplace/using-the-github-marketplace-api-in-your-app/webhook-events-for-the-github-marketplace-api)."

1. Navigate to your [{% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} listing page](https://github.com/marketplace/manage).

## Creating a {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} webhook

## Creating webhooks for a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}

You can subscribe your {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} to webhook events to receive notifications whenever certain events occur. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/using-webhooks-with-github-apps)."
