# Languages

Languages refers to the different translations we support on docs.github.com. Currently, our supported languages include Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, French, German, and Korean.

A Microsoft department runs our translations for us and updates private language specific repositories, such as `github/docs-internal.de-de`.

GitHub does not have direct control over translated content. For Hubbers and Microsoft employees, issues must be filled under <https://aka.ms/localizationfeedback>.
