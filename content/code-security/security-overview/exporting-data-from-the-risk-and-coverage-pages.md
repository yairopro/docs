## About exporting your risk and coverage data

{% data reusables.security-overview.download-csv-files %}

The CSV file you download will contain data corresponding to the filters you have applied to security overview. For example, if you add the filter `dependabot-alerts:enabled`, your file will only contain data for repositories that have enabled {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %}.

{% note %}

**Note:** You can only export data for the first 20 teams in your organization. These 20 teams correspond with the first 20 teams visible in the **Teams** {% octicon "triangle-down" aria-hidden="true" %} dropdown menu on security overview.

{% endnote %}

## Exporting risk or coverage data from your organization's security overview

{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
1. In the "Organizations" section, select the organization for which you would like to download risk and/or coverage data.
{% data reusables.organizations.security-overview %} By default, you will see the risk page of your organization's security overview.
1. If you would instead like to download coverage data for your organization, in the "Security" sidebar, click {% octicon "meter" aria-hidden="true" %} **Coverage**.
1. Next to the search bar, click {% octicon "download" aria-hidden="true" %} **Export CSV**.

    It may take a moment for {% data variables.product.product_name %} to generate the CSV file of your data. Once the CSV file generates, the file will automatically start downloading, and a banner will appear confirming your report is ready.
